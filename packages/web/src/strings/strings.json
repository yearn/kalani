  "new-project-p": "Projects are groups of 4626 vaults related by common governance and investment goals.",
  "new-project-governance": "Your project's Governance Address \n has full control over deployed vaults and can manage and collect fees.",
  "new-project-management": "Your project's Management Address is meant for day-to-day vault operations. Use it to maintain basic vault settings and manage strategies, debts, and reports. Providing a management address is recommended but optional and cannot be the same as your governance address.",
  "new-vault-category": "Optional. Use categories to..",
  "new-vault-min-change": "To start adding strategies to your vault, set a minimum change greater than 0. Minimum Change sets the minimum deposit needed to update a strategy's debt. Deposits below this threshold remain idle until enough funds accumulate—saving gas fees. For more guidance, ask on a Yearn-approved channel.",
  "new-vault-accept-fee-manager": "Your address, {0}, has been set as this vault's fee manager, but you must accept first!",
  "minimum-change": "Minimum Change sets the minimum deposit needed to update a strategy's debt. Deposits below this threshold remain idle until enough funds accumulate—saving gas fees.",
  "target-debt-ratio": "Target Debt Ratio is the desired allocation of the vault's assets this strategy should be lent at any given time.",
  "effective-debt-ratio": "Effective Debt Ratio is the percentage of the vault's total assets currently held by this strategy adjusted for gains or losses.",
  "max-debt": "Max Debt is the maximum amount of assets this strategy can borrow from the vault. For most strategies we recommend MAX (unlimited) for max debt. For high risk strategies max debt is used as a safety mechanism.",
  "strategy-queue": "The Strategy Queue contains up to 10 strategies and defines the default order in which strategies are called during withdrawals and auto-allocations. When a user withdraws funds, the vault attempts to pull assets from strategies in this order until the withdrawal is satisfied. When the vault auto-allocates idle funds, it deposits into strategies following this same order.",
  "use-default-queue": "When enabled, the vault will always use the default strategy queue for withdrawals, regardless of any custom withdrawal queue passed by users. This ensures consistent withdrawal ordering and prevents users from bypassing the vault's intended strategy priority.",
  "auto-allocate": "When enabled, the vault automatically allocates idle funds to strategies whenever a deposit occurs. Deposits are distributed to strategies following the default queue order, up to each strategy's target debt allocation. When disabled, deposited funds remain idle in the vault until manually allocated by the debt manager.",
  "management-fee": "Management Fee is a flat rate extracted by minting new shares (diluting participants). The fee is calculated and charged at harvest time based on time elapsed since the previous harvest.",
  "performance-fee": "Performance Fee is charged on profits earned by the vault and deducted during each strategy harvest. Performance fees are taken only from gains—never from principal deposits."
