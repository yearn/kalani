  "new-vault-min-change": "To start adding strategies to your vault, set a minimum change greater than 0. Minimum Change sets the minimum deposit needed to update a strategy's debt. Deposits below this threshold remain idle until enough funds accumulate—saving gas fees. For more guidance, ask on a Yearn-approved channel.",

When a user withdraws funds, the vault attempts to pull assets from strategies in this order until the withdrawal is satisfied. When the vault auto-allocates idle funds, it deposits into strategies following this same order.",

  "auto-allocate": "When enabled, the vault automatically allocates idle funds to strategies whenever a deposit occurs. Deposits are distributed to strategies following the default queue order, up to each strategy's target debt allocation. When disabled, deposited funds remain idle in the vault until manually allocated by the debt manager."
